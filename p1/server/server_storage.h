/// Storage is the main data type managed by the server.  For the time being, it
/// wraps a std::unordered_map that serves as an authentication table.  The
/// authentication table holds user names and hashed passwords, as well as a
/// single content object per user.
///
/// The public interface of Storage provides functions that correspond 1:1 with
/// the data requests that a client can make.  In that manner, the server
/// command handlers need only parse a request, send its parts to the Storage
/// object, and then format and return the result.
///
/// Storage is a persistent object.  For the time being, persistence is
/// achieved by writing the entire object to disk in response to SAV
/// messages. We use a relatively simple binary wire format:
///
///  - Each autnetication table entry begins with the magic 8-byte constant
///    AUTHAUTH
///  - Next comes a 4-byte binary write of the length of the username
///  - Then a binary write of the bytes of the username
///  - Then a binary write of the length of pass_hash
///  - Then a binary write of the bytes of pass_hash
///  - Then a binary write of num_bytes
///  - Finally, if num_bytes > 0, a binary write of the bytes field
///
/// This is repeated for each entry in the Auth table.
